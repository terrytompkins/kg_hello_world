Subjective:
Mrs. Emily Johnson brings Max in for sudden vomiting and diarrhea starting 2 days ago. Max has been lethargic, not eating well. No known ingestion of toxins, but was at the park where he might have eaten something. Previous arthritis noted, but joint supplement started after last visit seems helpful. No new medications besides carprofen used occasionally.

Objective:
Vital signs: Temperature 102.8Â°F (elevated), heart rate 110 bpm, respiratory rate 25 breaths/min. Weight: 72 lbs (down 3 lbs). Physical exam: Dehydrated (skin tenting), abdomen tender on palpation. Stool sample shows parasites. Blood work: Mild anemia, elevated white blood cells indicating infection.

Assessment:
Gastroenteritis likely due to parasitic infection (possible giardia from park water). Dehydration secondary to symptoms. Arthritis stable.

Plan:
Administer IV fluids for rehydration. Prescribe metronidazole 250mg twice daily for 7 days to treat parasites. Recommend bland diet (rice and boiled chicken) for 3-5 days. Probiotics supplement. Follow-up stool test in 2 weeks. Continue joint supplement and monitor weight. Advise avoiding parks until resolved.
