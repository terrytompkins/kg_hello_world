Subjective:
Owner reports that Max, a 5-year-old male Golden Retriever, has been generally healthy but recently showing mild lethargy after long walks. No changes in diet or environment. Owner, Mrs. Emily Johnson, mentions Max has been vaccinated annually, last rabies shot 6 months ago. No history of allergies. Max lives indoors with the family, including two children.

Objective:
Vital signs: Temperature 101.5Â°F (normal), heart rate 90 bpm, respiratory rate 20 breaths/min. Weight: 75 lbs (stable). Physical exam: Alert and responsive. Mild tartar on teeth. No abnormalities in eyes, ears, or skin. Abdomen soft, no pain on palpation. Gait normal, but slight stiffness in hind legs after exercise.

Assessment:
Mild lethargy likely due to early onset arthritis, common in breed. Dental health needs monitoring to prevent periodontitis.

Plan:
Recommend joint supplement (glucosamine 500mg daily). Schedule dental cleaning in 3 months. Advise shorter walks and monitor for worsening symptoms. Follow-up in 6 months or sooner if needed. Prescribe anti-inflammatory (carprofen 50mg as needed, max 2x/day).
